Instance Type : t2.2xlarge



Public DNS : ec2-15-206-92-130.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
Ssh Command : ssh -i "erav2r4.pem" ubuntu@ec2-15-206-92-130.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
IdentityFile : C:\Users\rrpalani\Downloads\keypair\erav2r4.pem

What are the steps Seema did ?
Created an instance in EC2 with instance type : t2.2xlarge
After creating instance of EC2 in AWS, SSH config is updated with new host settings to connect.
Remote Explorer, connect to that remote machine.
Explorer, accept everything to open the directory of that remote machine.
Jupyter extension installation in remote machine through market place.
Wait for some time to choose pytorch environment (conda env) from the drop down menu. If it asks to install python extension, go ahead.

#conda env list
#conda activate pytorch
Here appears now pytorch conda activated terminal
