## 004_ToSubmit_14_EraV2_S7_WithExpResults.ipynb
Targets: Above 99.4% test_acc with allowed number of params  
Results:  
    test_acc =  
        99.40% on 13th epoch  
        99.42% on 18th epoch

    total parameters = 7996  
Analysis:  Have very mild fluctuation in test acc from 13th epoch to 20th epoch. 
It has batch normalization, regularization, increased capacity, image augmentation, playing naively with learning rates.
